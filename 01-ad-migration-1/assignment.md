## 1) Introduction - Migrating from Microsoft AD DNS to Infoblox NIOS ‚Äì A Real-World Scenario
===

#  ‚ö° Pre-Intro: Consultant‚Äôs Lens

Here you‚Äôll experience a migration the same way an Infoblox Certified Consultant would.
The proprietary tools in this lab are available only through Infoblox Professional Services and Partner Professional Services, but the takeaway is clear:

üí° Infoblox experts bring the process, discipline, and speed that make customer migrations simple.


___

## Track Introduction

You are the DNS Lead for a global ACME enterprise that‚Äôs going all-in on a cloud-first strategy.
Identity services are moving to Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), which means the on-premises Active Directory Domain Controllers ‚Äî currently hosting DNS  ‚Äî are on the chopping block.

The mandate from leadership is clear:

‚ÄúMigrate our DNS services off Microsoft AD, keep everything online, and future-proof our infrastructure ‚Äî no downtime, no excuses.‚Äù

## Business Use Case

This migration isn‚Äôt just about replacing a service ‚Äî it‚Äôs about modernizing how critical network services are delivered:
- Cost Reduction ‚Äì Eliminate expensive, high-maintenance Windows Server DNS/DHCP roles.
- Operational Risk Mitigation ‚Äì Deploy DNS/DHCP in a highly available, cloud-native architecture.
- Centralized Control & Visibility ‚Äì Manage DNS globally with policy-based enforcement.
- Scalability & Agility ‚Äì Avoid hardware refresh cycles and easily extend services to new sites or clouds.

Your Mission in this Track

As the DNS Lead, you are responsible for executing the migration end-to-end. In this live hybrid lab, DC1 and DC2 are still running, but by the time you‚Äôre done, they‚Äôll be retired ‚Äî replaced by Infoblox NIOS as the new authoritative DNS platform.

You will:
1. Configure the Infoblox NIOS Grid Master to be migration-ready.
2. Export DNS data from AD, review it, and package it for import.
3. Create and run a migration job in the Infoblox Migration Portal ‚Äî handling a deliberately broken dataset and fixing it before import.
4. Validate DNS resolution from DC1, DC2, and the Client.
5. Execute go-live cutover scripts on DC1 and DC2.
6. Test resolution and browsing from the Client after switching DNS to NIOS.

By the end of this track, you‚Äôll have delivered a zero-downtime migration, resolved real-world data quality issues, and proven that Infoblox NIOS can take over seamlessly ‚Äî ready for the cloud era.

Let‚Äôs see how Infoblox can help you take DNS from legacy on-prem to modern, cloud-ready infrastructure.

Before any migration begins, you need full situational awareness.
As the DNS Lead, you‚Äôve just taken ownership of the project ‚Äî your first move is to review the current DNS environment, confirm the migration targets, and validate access to all involved systems.

Think of this as a recon mission: no changes yet, just verifying the battlefield.

üîç Tip: Check the Lab Diagram for a visual simulation of the setup before proceeding.


## 2) Login to your cloud account consoles
===
üîê Access Instructions

Using the credentials below, log in to the AWS and Azure Web Consoles.

---
# AWS Credentials ‚òÅÔ∏è

üîê Logging In to the AWS Console

üëâ First, open the ‚ÄúAWS Console‚Äù tab on the left-hand side of your Instruqt lab environment. This will launch the AWS login page in a new browser panel.

![Screenshot 2025-07-12 at 11.23.29.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/atmmwsclkofd/86d80bec0e3af0161dbb62f6e26e2626/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-12%20at%2011.23.29.png)

Then follow these steps:
1.	Select ‚ÄúIAM Account‚Äù
On the login screen, choose IAM Account (not root).

![Screenshot 2025-07-12 at 11.23.29.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/atmmwsclkofd/86d80bec0e3af0161dbb62f6e26e2626/assets/Screenshot%202025-07-12%20at%2011.23.29.png)

2.	Enter the AWS Account ID, AWS IAM username, and password by copying and pasting the values from the section below.

üìù Note: Avoid the root account login ‚Äî this lab is configured for IAM users only.

**AWS Account ID**
```
[[ Instruqt-Var key="INSTRUQT_AWS_ACCOUNT_INFOBLOX_DEMO_ACCOUNT_ID" hostname="shell" ]]
```

**AWS IAM Username**
```
[[ Instruqt-Var key="INSTRUQT_AWS_ACCOUNT_INFOBLOX_DEMO_USERNAME" hostname="shell" ]]
```

**AWS Password**
```
[[ Instruqt-Var key="INSTRUQT_AWS_ACCOUNT_INFOBLOX_DEMO_PASSWORD" hostname="shell" ]]
```

## 3) Validate AD/DNS Baseline Before Migration
===

‚úÖ Verify that the environment is healthy and that DNS data is in place before migration begins.


### üí° Lab Pre-Provisioning Recap

Your lab environment has already been prepped:

- Two Windows Domain Controllers (DC1 & DC2) deployed and configured.
- DC1 promoted as the forest root with AD-integrated DNS.
- DC2 joined and promoted as an additional domain controller with DNS.
- Active Directory & DNS roles installed and configured.
- DNS zones and records imported to Microsoft AD.
- Basic forwarders and replication set up between the two DCs.

### üîç Your task now:
Log in to DC1 and DC2 via RDP, open DNS Manager, and explore the imported zones and records to get familiar with the current setup. This is the baseline you‚Äôll migrate to Infoblox.


### üîç Accessing DNS Manager on DC1 and DC2


1. In the Tabs panel on the left of your lab interface, click Domain Controller 1 ‚Äì RDP to open the RDP session for DC1.
2. Once the Windows desktop loads, click Start Menu ‚Üí type DNS ‚Üí click DNS.

![Screenshot 2025-08-14 at 09.46.51.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/e6jecxl5nvew/a355aaa8c8391dc9a62b37d524780027/assets/Screenshot%202025-08-14%20at%2009.46.51.png)

4. In DNS Manager, expand your server node to review Forward Lookup Zones and verify imported zones/records.

![Screenshot 2025-08-14 at 09.47.15.png](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/e6jecxl5nvew/c8f4a8edc76c065ac1e5854f7ac07dde/assets/Screenshot%202025-08-14%20at%2009.47.15.png)


üé• Quick Demo: Want to see this validation (and maybe run it yourself)  in action from the client perspective? Click on the green button below.


[button label="Quick Validation Peek" background="#c2fbd7" color="green"](https://www.loom.com/share/d63efd783b564e24ae84a959e84d4f34?sid=61136739-2051-4d07-a03a-cc8386623d11)



5. Repeat the same process for Domain Controller 2 ‚Äì RDP to confirm replication and consistency.

üí° Tip: This quick check ensures your lab environment matches the pre-provisioned state before you start the migration.

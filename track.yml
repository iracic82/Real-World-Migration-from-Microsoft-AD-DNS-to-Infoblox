title: Real-World Migration from Microsoft AD DNS to Infoblox vNIOS
description: "\U0001F9ED Introduction\n\nYou’ve been appointed as the DNS lead for
  a company moving to the cloud, decommissioning Microsoft AD servers, and looking
  for a modern home for DNS. In this hands-on lab, you’ll simulate a real-world DNS
  migration from Microsoft AD DNS to Infoblox vNIOS, tackling challenges like data
  extraction, error handling, and cutover validation.\n\nYou’ll:\n- Start with two
  on-premises AD DNS servers (DC1 & DC2) populated with production zones.\n- Export
  DNS data, prepare it for Infoblox import, and handle format/policy errors.\n- Switch
  DNS resolution from Microsoft to Infoblox and validate functionality end-to-end.\n\nThis
  lab blends DNS modernization, data migration workflows, and service cutover best
  practices—exactly how you’d handle it in a real enterprise transformation.\n\n\U0001F3AF
  Lab Objectives\n- Review the current Microsoft AD DNS setup and connect to AWS-hosted
  lab resources.\n- Export, clean, and import DNS data into Infoblox vNIOS.\n- Cut
  over DNS resolution to Infoblox and validate client access."
